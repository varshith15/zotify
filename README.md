### More about search

- `-c` or `--category` can be used to limit search results to certain categories.
  - Available categories are "album", "artist", "playlist", "track", "show" and "episode".
  - You can search in multiple categories at once
- You can also narrow down results by using field filters in search queries
  - Currently available filters are album, artist, track, year, upc, tag:hipster, tag:new, isrc, and genre.
  - Available filters are album, artist, track, year, upc, tag:hipster, tag:new, isrc, and genre.
  - The artist and year filters can be used while searching albums, artists and tracks. You can filter on a single year or a range (e.g. 1970-1982).
  - The album filter can be used while searching albums and tracks.
  - The genre filter can be used while searching artists and tracks.
  - The isrc and track filters can be used while searching tracks.
  - The upc, tag:new and tag:hipster filters can only be used while searching albums. The tag:new filter will return albums released in the past two weeks and tag:hipster can be used to show only albums in the lowest 10% of popularity.

## Usage as a library

Zotify can be used as a user-friendly library for saving music, podcasts, lyrics and metadata.

Here's a very simple example of downloading a track and its metadata:

```python
from zotify import Session

session = Session.from_userpass(username="username", password="password")
track = session.get_track("4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT")
output = track.create_output("./Music", "{artist} - {title}")

file = track.write_audio_stream(output)

file.write_metadata(track.metadata)
file.write_cover_art(track.get_cover_art())
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome, but if adding an entirely new feature we encourage you to create an issue proposing the feature first so we can ensure it's something that fits the scope of the project.

Zotify aims to be a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for downloading music and podcasts.
It is designed to be simple by default but offer a high level of configuration for users that want it.
All new contributions should follow this principle to keep the program consistent.
